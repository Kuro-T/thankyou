    <div class="explain">The place I hardly recommend to visit in Japan is Minatomirai. Itâ€™s in little south and an hour by train from Tokyo. There is many touring spots, such as Yokohama Red Brick Warehouse and Nippon Maru Memorial Park. Also Minatomirai is known as beautiful night views. Tell me when you visit Japan. I would love to tour Minatomirai!!</div>
