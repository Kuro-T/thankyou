    <h2>Naoki's favorite</h2>
    <div class="explain">The place I hardly recommend to visit in Japan is Minatomirai. It’s in little south and an hour by train from Tokyo. There is many touring spots, such as Yokohama Red Brick Warehouse and Nippon Maru Memorial Park. Also Minatomirai is known as beautiful night views. Tell me when you visit Japan. I would love to tour Minatomirai!!

    <h2>Kota's favorite</h2>
    <div class="explain">I want to introduce you my hometown, Chiba prefecture. There is Tokyo Disney
      Land in Chiba and it is so great, but I want to introduce other spots you probably
      don’t know. I will tell you Sahara, the east part of Chiba. There are still some old
      streets and houses in Edo era, so you can fell the history in Japan!

      I recommend you to visit Ehime Prefecture when you visit Japan. It is my favorite place. It has
      both plenty of nature environment and sophisticated sightseeing spots.
      You’ll be able to be relaxed and have fun!

      Japanese traditional clothes.
